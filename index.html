                <h2>Biography</h2>
                <p>My name is Trevor Thompson. I currently live in Bend, OR and love anything that has to do with the outdoors. I love snowboarding and you can always find me on the mountain in my spare time.
                    I also love pets but unfortunately I currently don't own any pets. Even though I love the outdoors, I also really enjoy technology. Especially the idea of using technology to create real-world applications.
